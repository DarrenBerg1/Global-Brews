For my personal project, I am proposing making an online coffee shop that allows customers to create an account and purchase coffee. This shop will sell various types of coffee beans from around the world and even give details about each type of coffee and where it originates from. I will also intigrate a google map using the google map API. This page will allow the customer to search the country or location that the coffee is from, or to search if there are local coffee shops near them.

I am thinking to also use an API called coffee, to retrieve the photos.
